## 🌞 Solar Energy Prediction Using Weather Data

This project predicts solar power generation based on weather parameters such as temperature, cloud cover, and wind speed.
The dataset contains six months of simulated daily data, prepared for use in a solar energy prediction model and future app integration.

## ⚙️ Project Summary

The project involved complete data preprocessing and model training steps.
Data cleaning included fixing dates, removing noise, and ensuring consistency across temperature, cloud, and wind parameters.
A regression-based machine learning model was then trained to predict daily solar energy generation (in kWh) using these weather features.

## 🧠 Model Training

The model learns how different weather conditions impact daily solar output.
Training and testing results show a strong correlation between actual and predicted values, indicating reliable performance suitable for integration into an energy monitoring or forecasting app.

## 💡 Improvisations

Created 6-month simulated weather dataset for model training

Added essential features like Month and DayOfYear for temporal patterns

Cleaned and standardized numeric values

Completed full data preprocessing and training pipeline

Optimized the dataset for app-based prediction usage
