# Solar Energy Prediction Using Weather Data

This project analyzes solar power generation based on weather parameters like temperature, cloud cover, and wind speed.  
The dataset includes simulated data for six months and focuses on preprocessing and feature extraction steps.

## Improvisations
Created 6-month simulated data, added time features, cleaned dates, standardized values, and organized preprocessing clearly.
